    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <br>
    <h3 class="description"> Here at EDUdite, we merge two essential (yet often overlooked!) elements: <span style="color: #28CD96; font-family: gilroy-bold"> erudition and education. </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      Students all across our nation have collectively struggled with schooling during the pandemic, our nation's low rankings in education, and the looming pressure of their ambigious post-secondary goals. Experiencing all of these first-hand, our team of four identified a solution that could fix our many problems in education: incorporating every learning style in specialized curriculums.
      <br>
      <br>
      While there are MANY education websites out there, our website ditches conventional learning styles, no longer limiting to students to strict high school curriculums. Instead, we adapt to nuanced learning styles and strengths, constantly expanding our curriculum to encompass state and national needs.
      <br>
      <br>
      Made BY students FOR students, EDUdite believes in high quality education for EVERY learner out there, relying on everyone's unique strengths and interests to spark <span style="color: #28CD96; font-family: gilroy-bold"> erudition </span> within a subject, and, in turn, pave the way for equal opportunities in <span style="color: #28CD96; font-family: gilroy-bold"> education </span> for all.
