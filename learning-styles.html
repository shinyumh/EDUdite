    <!-- learning style 1 -->
    <h2>Visual</h2>
    <p>This preference includes the depiction of information in maps, diagrams, charts, graphs, symbolic arrows, circles, hierarchies and other devices that people use to represent what could have been presented in words. It does not include still pictures or photographs of reality, movies, videos or PowerPoint. It does include designs, whitespace, patterns, shapes and the different formats that are used to highlight and convey information.</p>

    <!-- learning style 2 -->
    <h2>Auditory</h2>
    <p>Those with this preference learn best from lectures, group discussion, radio, email, using mobile phones, speaking, web-chat and talking things through. The aural preference includes talking out loud as well as talking to oneself. People with this preference often want to sort things out by speaking first, rather than sorting out their ideas and then speaking. They need to say it themselves and they learn through saying it their way.</p>

    <!-- learning style 3 -->
    <h2>Read/write</h2>
    <p>This preference is for information displayed as words. This preference emphasizes text-based input and output â€“ reading and writing in all its forms but especially manuals, reports, essays, and assignments. People who prefer this modality are often addicted to PowerPoint, the Internet, lists, diaries, dictionaries, thesauri, quotations, and words.</p>

    <!-- learning style 4 -->
    <h2>Kinesthetic</h2>
    <p>People who prefer this mode are connected to reality. It includes demonstrations, simulations, videos of real things, as well as case studies, practice, and applications. The key is the reality or concrete nature of the example. People with this as a strong preference learn best from the experience of doing something and they value their own background of experiences and less so, the experiences of others.</p>

    <!-- learning style 5 -->
    <h2>Multi-Modality</h2>
    <p>Those who do not have a standout mode with one preference score well above other scores are defined as multimodal.</p>
