The title of our application is EDUdite.

The app's purpose is to customize learning towards learning style/individual preferences to improve current learning systems with the vision of improving graduation rates and lowering dropout rates.

What inspired us to create this app is the mutual struggle of having to learn through the pandemic alongside our nation's low rankings in education. Alongside this, many high schoolers are unsure of majors they want to study when applying to colleges. We believe in high quality education that can cater to learner's abilities to create a passion within a subject or play to a learner's strengths/interests, allowing equal opportunities in education for all.

What our app is trying to accomplish is to fill in the discrepancy of people's ability to gain high quality education that allows for curriculum to be taught using various learning styles or strengths. While there are many other educational websites, our website would help with appealing to students rather than standards with a focus in mastering the skills even outside of high school curriculum as well as encouraging students to have a more optimistic approach for learning. Further in our development, we hope to appeal to more nuances of learning styles and strengths while expanding our curriculum to encompass state and national needs.

Technical/coding difficulty that we faced in programming our app was making sure that every web page worked well and the user interface would work well with each other. We addressed this through peer review and numerous sessions discussing the needs for the users that aligns to the vision of the website's purpose: teaching high quality education for all. We have settled upon creating a well thought out dashboard and tabs that would help with ease of access navigating the website.
